Introduction to VR setup in Unity

In video 3.3 within game dev TV I had a lot of issues making the grab interactors work when adjusting the layer masks. I believe it stems from how I'm using an updated version of unity, which configures the grab and teleport interactables different. Currently the grabbable objects seem to be semi reliant on the teleport layer.
